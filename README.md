# Abstract
Objective

To identify eye movement patterns which are correlated with spatial disorientation (SD) events during flights in a flight simulator that induces SD
Background
Spatial Disorientation is one of the main causes for aviation mishaps. It is the result of an illusion, caused by misinterpreted vestibular or visual sensory cues, that leads to an incorrect perception of an aircraftâ€™s position, attitude, or motion. SD prevention is of great importance, as there is no objective tool to identify its occurrence. 

Method

Eye movements of 45 participants (30 aircrew members, 15 cadets) were recorded using Tobii Pro Glasses 2 in a Gyro-IPT SD flight simulator. Illusions were either vestibular or visual. Gaze metrics such as fixations, saccades (rapid gaze transfer between two points), and visits were compared between subjects who experienced SD and those who did not. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify significant differences.
Results

Among 284 flight profiles, 136 SD occurences were recorded (48%). During visual illusions the participants that more frequently checked the instrument panel had a higher chance of avoiding SD. In contrast, during vestibular illusions, participants who examined the head-up display (HUD) more frequently had a lower probability of SD occurrence.
Conclusion

Efficient SD mitigation technique requires task-specific eye-scanning strategies: to mitigate visual illusions there is a need for greater instrument panel focus, whereas to mitigate vestibular illusions increased HUD engagement is needed as opposed to the current instructions.

Application

Our findings may inform training programs to enhance performance in high-risk SD flight profiles. Additionally, results support the potential development of a real-time SD alert system for aircraft, aiming to mitigate or prevent SD-related incidents.
